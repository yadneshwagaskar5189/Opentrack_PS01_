"""30 everyday questions with checked answers: how the copilot learns the institute's language.

This is not model training. Each entry is a question staff really ask, written the way they ask
it (including "lec", "sir", "aaj"), with a SQL answer we tested against the real views. For every
new question the copilot picks the closest few entries the user's role is allowed to run and puts
them in the prompt as worked examples. The offline mock (LLM_PROVIDER=mock) answers these
questions directly. tests/test_question_bank.py runs every entry for every role.

SQL may use these dates, filled in at run time:
  {today} {tomorrow} {yesterday}   {week_end} = today + 6 ("this week")
  {next_mon} {next_sun} = next calendar week     {month_start} = 1st of this month
